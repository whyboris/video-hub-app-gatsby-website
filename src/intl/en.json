    "q2_answer": "You can have as many hubs (collections) as you would like. Perhaps you would like your Home Videos, Movies, and Experimental Projects in different, separate collections. Just create three hubs! You can switch between them either by double-clicking the file, dragging the file into the app, or clicking on the hub name in the recent history list inside the app.",
    "q3": "What happens to my video files?",
    "q3_answer": "All your videos remain unchanged. Video Hub App only takes screenshots of your videos so you can preview them at any time. If the videos are located on an external hard drive you will still be able to see them in Video Hub App whether the hard drive is connected or not.

Until you 'Rescan directory', all the old videos will still show up in Video Hub App, but clicking on a video you have deleted or renamed will no longer play the video. Rescanning the directory is quick, and afterwards Video Hub App will show an updated view of your videos.",

    "q6_answer": "You can drag & drop an image from your compter onto any video, and the default screenshot will be replaced.
