    "multifolder_a2": "Video Hub App 2 will create a hub from all the folders that are inside a folder you choose. There is no way to tell Video Hub App 2 to import from more than one source (starting) folder.",

    "q2": "Can I have more than one hub?",
    "q2_answer": "You can have as many hubs (collections) as you would like. Perhaps you would like your Home Videos, Movies, and Experimental Projects in different, separate collections. Just create three hubs! You can switch between them either by double-clicking the file, dragging the file into the app, or clicking on the hub name in the recent history list inside the app.",
    "q3": "What happens to my video files?",
    "q3_answer": "All your videos remain unchanged. Video Hub App only takes screenshots of your videos so you can preview them at any time. If the videos are located on an external hard drive you will still be able to see them in Video Hub App whether the hard drive is connected or not. But clicking the video will only open it in your video player if the external hard drive is connected.",
    "q4": "What happens when my videos change?",
    "q4_answer": "If you add, delete, or rename any videos, just click 'Rescan directory' and Video Hub App will update its internal collection to match your changes. Until you 'Rescan directory', all the old videos will still show up in Video Hub App, but clicking on a video you have deleted or renamed will no longer play the video. Rescanning the directory is quick, and afterwards Video Hub App will show an updated view of your videos.",
    "q5": "Can I sort videos by date?",
    "q5_answer": "Please go to settings, click the 'Search settings' tab, scroll to 'Sorting options in the dropdown' section, and click 'Date Modified' to enable the sorting option.",
    "q6": "Can I change the default thumbnail?",
    "q6_answer": "You can drag & drop an image from your compter onto any video, and the default screenshot will be replaced. Also, you can choose any one of the other extracted screenshots to be the default screenshot by opening the sheet / details vieow of a video (right click -> details, or click on top-right corner of thumbnail in Thumbnails view) and clicking the top-right corner (star) of any screenshot.",
